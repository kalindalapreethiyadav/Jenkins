we can store the varibles in a in manage crendential ,
That varibale can't be displayed anywhere(logs)
and can use that 

Master Node:-
        --> In master node :-
                -->> we install jenikis + ansible
                -->> we pass instrictions to agent servers (via "Node") to run the jobs in agent servers
                --->>We create "NOde" in manage Jenikins (mange Nodes & cloud) & provide the agent configuration details(like host & labels (labels are used to call by agent in script))
                ---->>In Jenkins GUOI , we create jobs (by providing the GIT SCM & running the scripts, cmd etc). 
                ----->> Jobs are different types we have like 
                            freestyle job (just excute cmd only but NO tracked for versions)
                            pipeline job ( Tracked by SCM & excute mutiple cmd, scripts etc)
                            mutipipleline job
       
        --> In Agent Server:-
                -->> we install java-11-openjdk to run jenikins jobs else it fails
                --->>All the jobs that are created in Master and RUN on it will be excuted in 
                agent server
                --->> WHEN WE CREATE A NODE IN MASTER AGENT SERVER (host details of agent..confi details etc provided), Automatically *.JAR FILES are created & generated in AGENT SERVER
                --->> JAR files are(remiting, remotting.jar) this some form of coding used by JENKINS that make RUN "AS PER MASTER INSTRUCTS IT FOLLOWS & EXCUTE IN AGENT)
